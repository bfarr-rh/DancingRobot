# Dance Rules 

This service provides Decision Manager Rules processing via kogito.

Rules have been build with DMN Decision Tables and context and build in the logic to take a value
received from the ML service based on Audio input and translate that to a Robot Sequence such as 
Left, Right, Up, Down, Spin Left, Spin Right.

This service can be independently built and run containerised in OpenShift.
